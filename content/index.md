I’m a physicist. My interests include condensed-matter/solid-state physics and quantum information science and technology. The merger of these two fields creates opportunities for new physics and technology, such as quantum computers. I work to advance these goals in various roles. I also have a long-term interest in the impact of science and technology on society.

This site serves as a repository for academic work and in no way represents the views or opinions of anyone but myself. Following tradition, most of this site will be very out-of-date.
