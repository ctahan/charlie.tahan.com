People who know me know that I can have a sarcastic sense of humor. And that I’m not shy about saying what I think. I have been known to poke fun at quantum over-exaggeration. I just don’t think overstating the importance of quantum computing is necessary. Unless we really don’t understand quantum mechanics, quantum computers represent a foundational shift in information science. That is important! Humanity has got to be working on building a useful quantum computer. Fundamentally, I support and cheer all the corporate teams of scientists and engineers out there trying to build a quantum computer and other quantum information technology.

And now I’m one of you.

Today I joined Microsoft Quantum. I will be leading a technical team in the Metro DC area to help accelerate the timeline to a quantum computer meaningful for society.

We are entering an era where quantum computing will empower science and scientists. We are finally on the verge of reconfigurable quantum systems that cannot be fully simulated by our best classical computers. I often get asked: what are the real applications of a quantum computer? Well,

Science is an application.

And probably the most important one, because the progress of science—everything from understanding how the universe really works to creating vaccines to discovering artificial intelligence—is pretty important to all of us. We already have a few well understood applications in chemistry and materials science for future quantum computers, and there will be more discovered as we actually have computers to run code on.

Microsoft’s mission is to “empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.” To me this absolutely also means empowering scientists to move faster. I can get behind that goal. Plus, Microsoft aspires to build “the world’s computer.” I believe quantum has to be a part of that vision. And I hope I can help make it happen faster.

I spent the last four years working on the National Quantum Initiative at the Office of Science and Technology Policy and launching the Qubit Collaboratory at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences because I firmly believe that government, industry (both big and small), national labs, and universities must all work together to drive quantum forward at this stage. There are many hard problems that must still be overcome—from fundamental physics to scaling to finding meaningful applications. While I was in the government I was really lucky to be able to create and run sponsored research programs in silicon and superconducting quantum computing; quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV); and new and emerging qubits (NEQST). I conducted academic-style research, ran research teams, acted as technical director driving research from high performance computing to foundational quantum information science to manufacturing and sensing. I oversaw the writing of national strategies. One of the superpowers of the U.S. federal government is its deep technical bench, and I was very fortunate to be trained in that august company.

I’m now excited to learn how the private sector side of things works and where Microsoft’s particular strengths and amazingly talented people can be brought to bear to create the future of computing.

So, back to work. (And please, always feel free to make fun of me too.)

Special note of thanks to the University of Maryland where I will maintain a research appointment.
